Python versions to support:

    Although I did learn how to configure Github workflows to run earlier
    Pythons, I decided to support Python 3.7 and higher. Python added f-strings
    in 3.6 and I don't really want to abandon those. Since 3.6 is already
    marked end-of-life, I opted to keep things simple and just support 3.7+,
    which can be exercised on ubuntu-latest.
